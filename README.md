# Chinese Checkers AI
- This is the repository for a strong Chinese Checkers agent trained with Heuristics, MCTS, and Reinforcement Learning
- The source code is almost complete while we're pushing the final changes
- Clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/kenziyuliu/PythonChineseCheckers.git` in your terminal

## Try for yourself:
1. Run `python3 human_vs_ai.py <model path>` to play against a pre-trained model. We have included two models for you to play against: `good_model.h5` and `good_model2.h5`. Depending on your style of playing, you may find one model stronger than the other.

## To play normal human vs human matches:
1. Run `python3 human_vs_human.py`

## To play against a simple greedy player:
1. Run `python3 human_vs_greedy.py`

## Some dependencies:
- Keras >= 2.1.6
- TensorFlow >= 1.6.0
- Python >= 3.6.5
- NumPy >= 1.14.3
- h5py >= 2.7.1
